# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].


Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Some key features that contribute to its popularity are:

Readable and expressive syntax: Python code is easy to read and write, which enhances productivity and reduces the cost of program maintenance.
Rich ecosystem and libraries: Python has a vast standard library and numerous third-party libraries for various tasks, from web development to scientific computing.
Cross-platform: Python runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms, making it versatile for different environments.
Integration and scripting: It is commonly used for scripting tasks and integrates well with other languages.
Community support: Python has a large and active community, providing resources, modules, and frameworks.
Python is used in web development (e.g., Django, Flask), scientific and numeric computing (e.g., NumPy, SciPy), data analysis (e.g., Pandas), artificial intelligence (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and automation.

Installing Python:
To install Python:

Windows: Download Python installer from python.org, run it, and select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

macOS: Python comes pre-installed. For the latest version, download the installer from python.org and follow the instructions.

Linux: Python is usually pre-installed. Use your package manager (apt, yum, etc.) to install if necessary (sudo apt install python3 for Ubuntu).

To verify installation:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Type python --version or python3 --version to check Python version.
To set up a virtual environment (recommended for project isolation):

Install virtualenv if not already (pip install virtualenv).
Create a virtual environment: virtualenv myenv.
Activate the environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
Python Syntax and Semantics:
python
# Simple Python program
print("Hello, World!")
Syntax elements: print() is a built-in function that outputs to the console. Strings are enclosed in quotes.
Data Types and Variables:
Basic data types in Python include:

int: integers (e.g., 42)
float: floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14)
str: strings (e.g., "Hello")
bool: boolean values (True or False)
Example script:

python
# Variables and data types
num1 = 10
num2 = 3.5
name = "Alice"
is_valid = True

print(num1 + num2)  # Output: 13.5
Control Structures:
Conditional statements (if-else):

python
# Conditional statement
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
Loops (for loop):

python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Functions in Python:
Functions are reusable blocks of code. Example:

python

# Function example
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
Lists and Dictionaries:
Lists are ordered collections of items, and dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

Example script:

python
# Lists and dictionaries
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

print(numbers[0])         # Output: 1
print(person['name'])     # Output: Alice
Exception Handling:
Exception handling deals with errors gracefully.

python

# Exception handling
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will execute no matter what")
Modules and Packages:
Modules are Python files containing definitions and statements, and packages are directories of modules. Example using math module:

python

# Using modules
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
File I/O:
Reading from a file:

python
# Reading from file
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

python
# Writing to file
data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for fruit in data:
        file.write(fruit + "\n")
